      "Use plist automatically for executing a facet expression against a collection alias backed by multiple collections"
    ],
    "description": [
      "For analytics use cases streaming expressions make it possible to compute basic aggregations count min max sum and average over massive data sets",
      "Moreover with massive data sets it is common to use collection aliases over many underlying collections for instance time partitioned aliases backed by a set of collections each covering a specific time range",
      "In some cases we can end up with many collections think each with s of shards",
      "Aliases help insulate client applications from complex collection topologies on the server side",
      "Let us take a basic facet expression that computes some useful aggregation metrics STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK Behind the scenes the CLASSNAME sends a JSON facet request to Solr which then expands the alias to a list of collections",
      "For each collection the top level distributed query controller gathers a candidate set of replicas to query and then scatters INLINECODESAMPLE queries to each replica in the list",
      "For instance if we have collections with shards each then this results in shard requests from the query controller node to the other nodes in the cluster",
      "The requests are sent in an async manner see CLASSNAME and CLASSNAME In my testing we have seen cases where we hit replicas and these queries do not always come back in a timely manner",
      "Put simply this also puts a lot of load on the top level query controller node in terms of open connections and new object creation",
      "Instead we can use METHODORVARIABLENAME to send the JSON facet query to each collection in the alias in parallel which reduces the overhead of each top level distributed query from to in my example above",
      "With this approach you will then need to sort the tuples back from each collection and do a rollup something like STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK One thing to point out is that you cannot just average",
      "the averages back from each collection in the rollup",
      "It needs to be a weighted average",
      "when rolling up the average",
      "from each facet expression in the plist",
      "However we have the count per collection so this is doable but will require some changes to the rollup expression to support weighted average",
      "While this plist approach is doable it is a pain for users to have to create the rollup sort over plist expression for collection aliases",
      "After all aliases are supposed to hide these types of complexities from client applications",
      "The point of this ticket is to investigate the feasibility of auto wrapping the facet expression with a rollup sort plist when the collection argument is an alias with multiple collections other stream sources will be considered after facet is proven out",
      "Lastly I also considered an alternative approach of doing a parallel relay on the server side",
      "The idea is similar to METHODORVARIABLENAME but instead of this being driven on the client side the CLASSNAME can create intermediate queries I called them METHODORVARIABLENAME queries in my impl",
      "that help distribute the load",
      "In my example above there would be such relay queries each sent to a replica for each collection in the alias which then sends the INLINECODESAMPLE queries to each replica",
      "The relay query response handler collects the facet responses from each replica before sending back to the top level query controller for final results",
      "I have this approach working in the attached patch ATTACHMENT but it feels a little invasive to the CLASSNAME and the distributed query inner workings in general",
      "To me the auto METHODORVARIABLENAME approach feels like a better layer to add this functionality vs deeper down in the facet module code",
      "Moreover we may be able to leverage the METHODORVARIABLENAME solution for other stream sources whereas the relay approach required me to change logic in the CLASSNAME directly so is likely not as reusable for other types of queries",
      "It is possible the relay approach could be generalized but I am not clear how useful that would be beyond streaming expression analytics use cases feedback on this point welcome of course",
      "I also think METHODORVARIABLENAME should try to be clever and avoid sending the top level per collection request to the same node if it can help it"

    ],
    "description": [
      "Search engines have traditionally relied upon token based matching typically keywords on an inverted index plus relevance ranking based upon keyword occurrence statistics",
      "This can be viewed as a sparse vector match where each term is a one hot encoded dimension in the vector since only a few keywords out of all possible keywords are considered in each query",
      "With the introduction of deep learning based transformers over the last few years however the state of the art in relevance has moved to ranking models based upon dense vectors that encode a latent semantic understanding of both language constructs and the underlying domain upon which the model was trained",
      "These dense vectors are also referred to as embeddings",
      "An example of this kind of embedding would be taking the phrase chief executive officer of the tech company and converting it to VERSIONNUMBER VERSIONNUMBER VERSIONNUMBER VERSIONNUMBER",
      "Other similar phrases should encode to vectors with very similar numbers so we may expect a query like CEO of a technology org to generate a vector like VERSIONNUMBER VERSIONNUMBER VERSIONNUMBER VERSIONNUMBER VERSIONNUMBER",
      "When performing a cosine similarity calculation between these vectors we would expect a number closer to VERSIONNUMBER whereas a very unrelated text blurb would generate a much smaller cosine similarity",
      "This is a proposal for how we should implement these vector search capabilities in Solr",
      "Search Process Overview In order to implement dense vector search the following process is typically followed Offline An encoder is built",
      "An encoder can take in text a query a sentence a paragraph a document etc",
      "and return a dense vector representing that document in a rich semantic space",
      "The semantic space is learned from training on textual data usually though other sources work too typically from the domain of the search engine",
      "Document Ingestion When documents are processed they are passed to the encoder and the dense vector s returned are stored as fields on the document",
      "There could be one or more vectors per document as the granularity of the vectors could be per document per field per paragraph per sentence or even per phrase or per term",
      "Query Time Encoding The query is translated to a dense vector by passing it to the encoder Quantization The query is quantized",
      "Quantization is the process of taking a vector with many values and turning it into terms in a vector space that approximates the full vector space of the dense vectors",
      "ANN Matching A query on the quantized vector tokens is executed as an ANN approximate nearest neighbor search",
      "This allows finding most of the best matching documents typically up to with a traditional and efficient lookup against the inverted index",
      "optional ANN Ranking ranking may be performed based upon the matched quantized tokens to get a rough initial ranking of documents based upon the similarity of the query and document vectors",
      "This allows the next step re ranking to be performed on a smaller subset of documents",
      "Re Ranking Once the initial matching and optionally ANN ranking is performed a similarity calculation cosine dot product or any number of other calculations is typically performed between the full non quantized dense vectors for the query and those in the document",
      "This re ranking will typically be on the top N results for performance reasons",
      "Return Results As with any search the final step is typically to return the results in relevance ranked order",
      "In this case that would be sorted by the re ranking similarity score ie",
      "cosine descending",
      "Variant For small document sets it may be preferable to rank all documents and skip steps steps and",
      "This is because ANN Matching typically reduces recall current state of the art is around recall so it can be beneficial to rank all documents if performance is not a concern",
      "In this case step is performed on the full doc set and would obviously just be considered ranking instead of re ranking",
      "Proposed Implementation in Solr Phase Storage of Dense Vectors Scoring on Vector Similarity Dense Vector Field We will add a new dense vector field type in Solr",
      "This field type would be a compressed encoding of a dense vector into a SIMPLECLASSNAME Field",
      "There are other ways to do it but this is almost certain to be the most efficient",
      "Ideally this field is multi valued",
      "If it is single valued then we are either limited to only document level vectors or otherwise we have to create many vector fields ie",
      "per paragraph or term and search across them which will never be practical or scale well",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME does not natively support multiple values but since the Solr field type will need to be responsible for encoding the numeric vectors as a byte it should also be able to encode multiple vectors at the same time",
      "Vector Similarity Value Sources Implement function queries value sources that take in a query vector a multi valued vector field name and a multi value selector max min average first and return the computed calculation",
      "This function could then be used to score documents via the func query parser",
      "ANN queries could be implemented using separate fq params for filtering or as part of the q query parameter to support optional ANN Ranking and then the existing Solr re ranking functionality could be used for re ranking the top N results using the func query parser and these new cosine or dot product value sources as the re rank query",
      "Existing Solr logic for performing two phase iteration will ensure that these vector functions will not be excessively computed for documents that do not already match the cheaper ANN queries",
      "Example NOFORMATBLOCK simple no ANN",
      "Third param is optional and is the function min max average first last",
      "I think this should default to max or whatever most related is for each similarity function",
      "It is max for cosine and dot product",
      "Example NOFORMATBLOCK ensures function is not computed unless ANN query matches due to two phase iterator Example NOFORMATBLOCK Supports an initial ranking based upon the ANN QUERY followed by a re ranking based upon the cosine function",
      "The key implementation challenges are expected to be ensuring decent query speed performance",
      "determining an efficient vector byte encoding that has decent disk space query time decoding trade offs and makes it possible to decode only the first vector per doc in cases where that is all that is requested by the distance function",
      "Phase Pluggable ANN Search implement pluggable quantization ann search",
      "there are multiple different algorithms to do quantization for efficient ann search",
      "the simplest is something like lsh with more advanced implementations being worked on in lucene right now in lucene hnsw and lucene ivfflat and with a prototyped lsh implementation solr vector search plugin and a random projections approach hangry linked to in solr",
      "given that the transformers encoders are a rapidly evolving area of data science and nlp research it feels unreasonable to assume that solr will be able to keep up to date on the latest model integrations",
      "given that if we build support into solr for encoder models we need to make it very pluggable",
      "phase fully enables quantization to be done outside of solr and thus for external systems to accomplish quantization by creating quantized terms externally indexing them to solr and then sending in queries to solr with the quantized terms",
      "i am not convinced that keeping quantization outside of lucene solr is not a more manageable model long term but if certain models do get integrated natively into lucene as is currently being worked on then we should obviously look to leverage them",
      "Important Considerations multi valued dense vectors are a key differentiating feature here",
      "i am considering this a key requirement and designing accordingly",
      "this will allow for multiple embeddings per document ie",
      "word embeddings sentence embeddings paragraph embeddings etc",
      "to be modeled",
      "i like the way userprofilelink designed the the payload function query and think we should model the multi valued handling similarly",
      "as best as possible it would be nice to support multiple pluggable fields value sources that can be converted to dense vectors and compared",
      "at a minimum we need an efficient dense vector field but it may be beneficial to support a sparse vector field where only meaningful values need to be encoded in order to save space",
      "additionally there may be some utility in other field types or arbitrary value sources that can product vector like output to be able to be leveraged in the function queries being proposed",
      "Note on Prior Approaches there are a handful of ways to perform vector search today with solr",
      "one is through streaming expressions and alternatively there are a few plugins which have implemented this functionality for solr",
      "one of these was contributed in solr and i have outlined examples of most of these approaches in the comments on solr",
      "the streaming expressions approach works well out of the box but does not integrate nicely with traditional keyword search use cases so we need a solution that integrates with real time queries and enables the full suite of solr s query time features",
      "the most advanced solr plugin out there seems to be this one githublink forked the version in solr and then added lsh functionality for ann",
      "i encountered several challenges when working with the implementation in solr which informed the above proposed design",
      "The plugin encodes dense vectors into payloads attached to terms representing vector positions",
      "This is pretty inefficient and is way too slow at significant scale",
      "I believe we instead need the underlying field types to be binary doc values field with efficient compression and decoding for optimal performance when scanning through all the matching documents and dimensions",

      "The plugin uses a query parser instead of just a function query which prevents re use of the vector similarity function",

      "Given that there are two goals of filtering on ANN and Scoring on vector similarity usually via re ranking using a function query for the scoring piece will be more flexible across use scoring use cases combining with other functions returning sorting etc",
      "The LSH quantization ANN implementation is a cool idea but it is hard coded in the implementation",
      "I recommend making it a separate filter and making the implementation more pluggable though for now this can be externalized and passed in to Solr",

      "Current approach problem of Solr Below is the diagram describe the model on how currently handling a request",
      "IMAGEATTACHMENT The main thread that handles the search requests will submit n requests n equals to number of shards to an executor",
      "So each request will correspond to a thread after sending a request that thread basically do nothing just waiting for response from other side",
      "That thread will be swapped out and CPU will try to handle another thread this is called context switch CPU will save the context of the current thread and switch to another one",
      "When some data not all come back that thread will be called to parsing these data then it will wait until more data come back",
      "So there will be lots of context switching in CPU",
      "That is quite inefficient on using METHODORVARIABLENAME we want less threads and most of them must busy all the time because threads are not free as well as context switching",
      "That is the main idea behind everything like executor",
      "Async call of Jetty SIMPLECLASSNAME Jetty SIMPLECLASSNAME offers async API like this",
      "STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK Therefore after calling METHODORVARIABLENAME the thread will return immediately without any block",
      "Then when the client received the header from other side it will call METHODORVARIABLENAME listeners",
      "When the client received some INLINECODESAMPLE not all response from the data it will call METHODORVARIABLENAME listeners",
      "When everything finished it will call METHODORVARIABLENAME listeners",
      "One main thing that will must notice here is all listeners should finish quick if the listener block all further data of that request will not be handled until the listener finish",
      "",
      "Solution Sending requests async but spin one thread per response Jetty SIMPLECLASSNAME already provides several listeners one of them is SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "This is how it is get used STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK In this case there will be thread one thread trying to read the response content from inputstream",
      "one thread this is a short live task feeding content to above inputstream whenever some byte is available",
      "note that if this thread unable to feed data into inputstream this thread will wait",
      "By using this one the model of SIMPLECLASSNAME can be written into something like this STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK The first diagram will be changed into this IMAGEATTACHMENT Notice that although sending req to shard is wide it will not take long time since sending req is a very quick operation",
      "With this operation handling threads will not be spin up until first bytes are sent back",
      "Notice that in this approach we still have active threads waiting for more data from SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "Solution Buffering data and handle it inside jetty s thread",
      "Jetty have another listener called SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "This is how it is get used STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK On receiving data Jetty one of its thread will call the listener with the given data data here is just byte represent part of the response",
      "The listener will then buffer that byte into an internal buffer",
      "When all the data are received Jetty will call SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME of the listener and inside that method we will get all the response",
      "By using this one the model of SIMPLECLASSNAME can be written into something like this STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK The first diagram will be changed into this IMAGEATTACHMENT Pros we do not need additional threads for each request less threads",
      "no thread are activately waiting for data from an inputstream threads are more busy",
      "Cons data must be buffered all before able being to parse double memory being used for parsing a response",
      "",
      "Solution Why not both",
      "Solution is good for parsing very large response or sometimes unbounded like in SIMPLECLASSNAME response",
      "Solution is good for parsing small response may be KB since overhead is little",
      "Should we combine both solutions above",
      "After all what is returned by SIMPLECLASSNAME so far for all requests is a SIMPLECLASSNAME so as long as we can return a SIMPLECLASSNAME using Solution or Solution are not matter with users",
      "Therefore the idea here is based on CONTENT_LENGTH of the response s headers",
      "If the response body less than a certain size we will go with solution and vice versa",
      "Note Solr seems does not return content length accurately need more investigation",
      "",
      "Further improvement The best approach to solve this problem is instead of converting SIMPLECLASSNAME to SIMPLECLASSNAME why do not we just converting byte by byte and make it resumable",
      "Like this STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK Therefore there will be no blocking operation inside parser thus making a very efficient model",
      "But doing this requires tons of change in Solr rewrite all SIMPLECLASSNAME in Solr not mention the flow here must be rewritten",

    ],
    "description": [
      "Solr does not have a facet count cache so for every request term facets are recalculated for every facet field by iterating over every field value for every doc in the result domain and incrementing the associated count",
      "As a result subsequent requests end up redoing a lot of the same work including all associated object allocation GC etc",
      "This situation could benefit from integrated caching",
      "Because of the domain based serial iterative nature of term facet calculation latency is proportional to the size of the result domain",
      "Consequently one common clear manifestation of this issue is high latency for faceting over an unrestricted domain eg INLINECODESAMPLE as might be observed on a top level landing page that exposes facets",
      "This type of static case is often mitigated by external to Solr caching either with a caching layer between Solr and a front end application or within a front end application or even with a caching layer between the end user and a front end application",
      "But in addition to the overhead of handling this caching elsewhere in the stack or for a new user even being aware of this as a potential issue to mitigate any external caching mitigation is really only appropriate for relatively static cases like the landing page example described above",
      "A Solr internal facet count cache analogous to the METHODORVARIABLENAME would provide the following additional benefits ease of use out of the box configuration to address a common performance concern",
      "compact specifically caching count arrays without the extra baggage that accompanies a naive external caching approach",
      "nrt friendly could be implemented to be segment aware",
      "modular capable of reusing the same cached values in conjunction with variant requests over the same result domain this would support common use cases like paging but also potentially more interesting direct uses of facets",
      "could be used for distributed refinement ie if facet counts over a given domain are cached a refinement request could simply look up the ordinal value for each enumerated term and directly grab the count out of the count array that was cached during the first phase of facet calculation",
      "composable eg in aggregate functions that calculate values based on facet counts across different domains like skg relatedness see solr"

      "breaking this out from SOLR please read there for further background Before this patch the api is quite confusing IMHO any code that wanted to know what the properties for a collection are could call METHODORVARIABLENAME collection but this was a dangerous and trappy api because that was a query to zookeeper every time",
      "if a naive user auto completed that in their ide without investigating heavy use of zookeeper would ensue",
      "to do it right for any code that might get called on a per doc or per request basis one had to cause caching by registering a watcher",
      "at which point the getcollectionproperties collection magically becomes safe to use but the watcher pattern probably looks famillar induces a user who has not read the solr code closely to create their own cache and update it when their watcher is notified",
      "if the caching side effect of watches is not understood this will lead to many in memory copies of collection properties maintained in user code",
      "this also creates a task to be scheduled on a thread propsnotification and induces an extra thread scheduling lag before the changes can be observed by user code",
      "the code that cares about collection properties needs to have a lifecycle tied to either a collection or something other object with an even more ephemeral life cycle such as an urp",
      "the user now also has to remember to ensure the watch is unregistered or there is a leak",
      "After this patch calls to getcollectionproperties collection are always safe to use in any code anywhere",
      "caching and cleanup are automatic",
      "code that really actually wants to know if a collection property changes so it can wake up and do something autoscaling",
      "still has the option of registering a watcher that will asynchronously send them a notification",
      "updates can be observed sooner via getcollectionproperties with no need to wait for a thread to run",
      "vs a cache held in user code"

      "For the majority of the cases current SIMPLECLASSNAME s distributed indexing is great",
      "There is a subset of use cases for which the legacy Master Slave replication may fit better do not require nrt",
      "lir can become an issue prefer availability of reads vs consistency or nrt",
      "high number of searches requiring many search nodes",
      "SOLR is adding replicas that do not do indexing just update their transaction log",
      "This Jira is to extend that idea and provide the following replica types Realtime Writes updates to transaction log and indexes locally",
      "Replicas of type realtime support NRT soft commits and RTG",
      "Any realtime replica can become a leader",
      "This is the only type supported in SIMPLECLASSNAME at this time and will be the default",
      "Append Writes to transaction log but not to index uses replication",
      "Any append replica can become leader by first applying all local transaction log elements",
      "If a replica is of type append but is also the leader it will behave as a realtime",
      "This is exactly what SOLR is proposing non live replicas Passive Does not index or writes to transaction log",
      "Just replicates from realtime or append replicas",
      "Passive replicas cannot become shard leaders ie if there are only passive replicas in the collection at some point updates will fail same as if there is no leaders queries continue to work so they do not even participate in elections",
      "When the leader replica of the shard receives an update it will distribute it to all realtime and append replicas the same as it does today",
      "It will not distribute to passive replicas",
      "By using a combination of append and passive replicas one can achieve an equivalent of the legacy Master Slave architecture in SIMPLECLASSNAME mode with most of its benefits including high availability of writes",
      "API v style INLINECODESAMPLE INLINECODESAMPLE replicationfactor will translate to realtime for back compatibility",
      "if passive append or realtime need to be cannot be all passives",
      "Placement Strategies By using replica placement rules one should be able to dedicate nodes to search only and write only workloads",
      "For example STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK where type is a new condition supported by the rule engine and fleet slaves is a regular tag",
      "Note that rules are only applied when the replicas are created so a later change in tags will not affect existing replicas",
      "Also rules are per collection so each collection could contain it is own different rules",
      "Note that on the server side Solr also needs to know how to distribute the shard requests maybe SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "if we want to hit only a subset of replicas ie",
      "passive replicas only or similar rules SIMPLECLASSNAME SIMPLECLASSNAME client could be smart to prefer passive replicas for search requests when available and if configured to do so",
      "Passive replicas cannot respond RTG requests so those should go to realtime replicas",
      "Cluster Collection state STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK Back compatibility We should be able to support back compatibility by assuming replicas without a type property are realtime replicas",
      "Failure Scenarios for passive replicas Replica Leader partition In SIMPLECLASSNAME today in this scenario the replica would be placed in LIR",
      "With passive replicas replicas may not be able to replicate from some time and fall behind with the index but queries can still be served",
      "Once the connection is re established the replication will continue",
      "Replica Technology Names partition Passive replica will leave the cluster",
      "Smart clients and other replicas eg",
      "for distributed search will not find it and will not query on it",
      "Direct search requests to the replica may still succeed",
      "Passive replica dies or is unreachable Replica will not be query able",
      "On restart replica will recover from the leader following the same flow as realtime replicas set state to DOWN then RECOVERING and finally ACTIVE",
      "Passive replicas will use a different CLASSNAME implementation that omits preparerecovery and peer sync attempt it will jump to replication",
      "If the leader did not change or if the other replicas are of type append replication should be incremental",

      "Q A Can I use a combination of passive realtime",
      "You could",
      "The problem is that since realtime generate their own index any change of leadership could trigger a full replication from all the passive replicas",
      "The biggest benefits of append replicas is that they share the same index files which means that even if the leader changes the number of segments to replicate will remain low",
      "For that reason using append replicas is recommended when using passive",
      "Can I use passive append realtime",
      "The issue with mixing realtime replicas with append replicas is that if a different realtime replica becomes the leader the whole purpose of using append replicas is defeated since they will all have to replicate the full index",
      "What happens if replication from passives fail",
      "TBD In general we want those replicas to continue serving search traffic but we may want to have a way to say If cannot replicate after X hours put yourself in recovery or something similar",
      "USERPROFILELINK suggested that we include in the response time since the last successful replication and then the client can choose what to do with the results in a multi shard request this date would be the oldest of all shards",
      "Do passive replicas need to replicate from the leader only",
      "This is not necessary",
      "Passive replicas can replicate from any realtime or append replicas although this would add some extra waiting time for the last updates",
      "Replicating from a realtime replica may not be a good idea see the question Can I use a combination of passive realtime What if I need NRT",
      "Then you cannot query append or passive replicas",
      "You should use all realtime replicas Will new passive replicas start receiving traffic immediately after added",
      "passive replicas will have the same states as realtime append replicas they will join the cluster as DOWN and be moved to RECOVERY until they can replicate from the leader",
      "Then they will start the replication process and become ACTIVE at this point they will start responding queries",
      "They will use a different CLASSNAME that skips peer sync and buffering of docs and just replicates",
      "What if a passive replica receives an update",
      "This will work the same as today with non leader replicas it will just forward the update to the correct leader",

      "Here by snapshot I mean configuring the underlying Lucene SIMPLECLASSNAME to not delete a specific commit point eg",

      "This should not be confused with SOLR which implements core level backup functionality",
      "The primary motivation of this feature is to decouple recording preserving a known consistent state of a collection from actually copying the relevant files to a physically separate location",
      "This decoupling have number of advantages we can use specialized data copying tools for transferring solr index files",
      "eg",
      "in hadoop environment typically distcp weblink tool is used to copy files from one location to other",
      "this tool provides various options to configure degree of parallelism bandwidth usage as well as integration with different types and versions of file systems eg",
      "aws s azure blob store etc",
      "this separation of concern would also help solr to focus on the key functionality ie",
      "querying and indexing while delegating the copy operation to the tools built for that purpose",

      "Issues radial view does not scale beyond a small number of nodes collections",
      "paging on the graph view is based on collections so a collection with many replicas will not be subject to pagination",
      "the dump feature is kind of redundant and should be removed",
      "there is now a major overlap in functionality with the new collections tab",
      "What I would propose is that we promote the tree tab to top level",
      "remove the graph views and the dump tab",
      "add a new nodes tab",
      "This nodes tab would complement the collections tab showing nodes and their associated replicas collections",

      "It would also be possible to filter nodes by status show me only up nodes show me nodes that are in trouble show me nodes that have leaders on them etc",
      "Presumably if we have APIs to support it we might have a decommission node option that would ensure that no replicas on this node are leaders and then remove all replicas from the node ready for it to be removed from the cluster"

    ],
    "description": [
      "I have been thinking about how SIMPLECLASSNAME deals with write availability using in sync replica sets in which writes will continue to be accepted so long as there is at least one healthy node per shard",
      "For a little background and to verify my understanding of the process is correct SIMPLECLASSNAME only considers active healthy replicas when acknowledging a write",
      "Specifically when a shard leader accepts an update request it forwards the request to all active healthy replicas and only considers the write successful if all active healthy replicas ack the write",
      "Any down gone replicas are not considered and will sync up with the leader when they come back online using peer sync or snapshot replication",
      "For instance if a shard has nodes A B C with A being the current leader then writes to the shard will continue to succeed even if B C are down",
      "The issue is that if a shard leader continues to accept updates even if it loses all of its replicas then we have acknowledged updates on only node",
      "If that node call it A then fails and one of the previous replicas call it B comes back online before A does then any writes that A accepted while the other replicas were offline are at risk to being lost",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME does provide a safe guard mechanism for this problem with the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME setting which puts any replicas that come back online before node A into a temporary wait state",
      "If A comes back online within the wait period then all is well as it will become the leader again and no writes will be lost",
      "As a side note sys admins definitely need to be made more aware of this situation as when I first encountered it in my cluster I had no idea what it meant",
      "My question is whether we want to consider an approach where SIMPLECLASSNAME will not accept writes unless there is a majority of replicas available to accept the write",
      "For my example under this approach we would not accept writes if both B C failed but would if only C did leaving A B online",
      "Admittedly this lowers the write availability of the system so may be something that should be tunable",
      "From Mark M Yeah this is kind of like one of many little features that we have just not gotten to yet",
      "I have always planned for a param that let us you say how many replicas an update must be verified on before responding success",
      "Seems to make sense to fail that type of request early if you notice there are not enough replicas up to satisfy the param to begin with"

      "Join Contrib"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This contrib provides a place where different join implementations can be contributed to Solr",
      "This contrib currently includes join implementations",
      "The initial patch was generated from the Solr VERSIONNUMBER tag",
      "Because of changes in the SIMPLECLASSNAME API this patch will only build with Solr VERSIONNUMBER or above",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME aka hjoin The hjoin provides a join implementation that filters results in one core based on the results of a search in another core",
      "This is similar in functionality to the SIMPLECLASSNAME but the implementation differs in a couple of important ways",
      "The first way is that the hjoin is designed to work with int and long join keys only",
      "So in order to use hjoin int or long join keys must be included in both the to and from core",
      "The second difference is that the hjoin builds memory structures that are used to quickly connect the join keys",
      "So the hjoin will need more memory then the SIMPLECLASSNAME to perform the join",
      "The main advantage of the hjoin is that it can scale to join millions of keys between cores and provide sub second response time",
      "The hjoin should work well with up to two million results from the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME and tens of millions of results from the main query",
      "The hjoin supports the following features Both lucene query and SIMPLECLASSNAME implementations",
      "A cost will turn on the SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "The SIMPLECLASSNAME will typically outperform the Lucene query when the main query results have been narrowed down",
      "With the lucene query implementation there is an option to build the filter with threads",
      "This can greatly improve the performance of the query if the main query index is very large",
      "The threads parameter turns on threading",
      "For example threads will use threads to build the filter",
      "This will setup a fixed threadpool with six threads to handle all hjoin requests",
      "Once the threadpool is created the hjoin will always use it to build the filter",
      "Threading does not come into play with the SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "The size local parameter can be used to set the initial size of the hashset used to perform the join",
      "If this is set above the number of results from the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME then the you can avoid hashset resizing which improves performance",
      "Nested filter queries",
      "The local parameter fq can be used to nest a filter query within the join",
      "The nested fq will filter the results of the join query",
      "This can point to another join to support nested joins",
      "Full caching support for the lucene query implementation",
      "The SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME and SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME should work properly even with deep nesting of joins",
      "Only the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME comes into play with the SIMPLECLASSNAME implementation because SIMPLECLASSNAME are not cacheable in the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "The syntax of the hjoin is similar to the SIMPLECLASSNAME except that the plugin is referenced by the string hjoin rather then join",
      "fq hjoin SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME collection from idi to idi threads fq qq user customer qq group The example filter query above will search the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME collection for user customer applying the local fq parameter to filter the results",
      "The lucene filter query will be built using threads",
      "This query will generate a list of values from the from field that will be used to filter the main query",
      "Only records from the main query where the to field is present in the from list will be included in the results",
      "The FILEPATH in the main query core must contain the reference to the hjoin",
      "And the join contrib lib jars must be registed in the FILEPATH",
      "After issuing the ant dist command from inside the solr directory the joins contrib jar will appear in the solr dist directory",
      "Place the the solr joins",
      "jar in the WEB INF lib directory of the solr webapplication",
      "This will ensure that the top level Solr classloader loads these classes rather then the core s classloaded",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME aka bjoin The bjoin behaves exactly like the hjoin but uses a SIMPLECLASSNAME instead of a SIMPLECLASSNAME to perform the underlying join",
      "Because of this the bjoin is much faster and can provide sub second response times on result sets of tens of millions of records from the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME and hundreds of millions of records from the main query",
      "But there are limitations to how the bjoin can be used",
      "The bjoin treats the join keys as addresses in a SIMPLECLASSNAME and uses the Lucene SIMPLECLASSNAME implementation which performs very well but is not sparse",
      "So the SIMPLECLASSNAME memory is dictated by the size of the join keys",
      "For example a bitset with a max join key of will need MB of memory",
      "For this reason the SIMPLECLASSNAME join does not support long join keys",
      "In order to keep memory usage down the join keys should also be packed at the low end for example from to",
      "Below is a sampe bjoin fq bjoin SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME collection from idi to idi threads fq qq user customer qq group To register the bjoin the FILEPATH in the main query core must contain the reference to the bjoin",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME aka vjoin The second implementation is the SIMPLECLASSNAME aka vjoin",
      "This implements a SIMPLECLASSNAME function query that can return a value from a second core based on join keys and limiting query",
      "The limiting query can be used to select a specific subset of data from the join core",
      "This allows customer specific relevance data to be stored in a separate core and then joined in the main query",
      "The vjoin is called using the vjoin function query",
      "For example bf vjoin fromCore SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME query This example shows vjoin being called by the edismax boost function parameter",
      "This example will return the fromVal from the fromCore",
      "The fromKey and toKey are used to link the records from the main query to the records in the fromCore",
      "The query is used to select a specific set of records to join with in SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "Currently the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME and SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME must be longs but this will change in future versions",
      "Like the pjoin the join SIMPLECLASSNAME is used to hold the join memory structures",
      "To configure the vjoin you must register the SIMPLECLASSNAME plugin in the FILEPATH as follows"

      "It would be very good to get a default field type defined for Japanese in METHODORVARIABLENAME so we can good Japanese out of the box support in Solr",
      "I have been playing with the below configuration today which I think is a reasonable starting point for Japanese",
      "There is lot to be said about various considerations necessary when searching Japanese but perhaps a wiki page is more suitable to cover the wider topic",
      "In order to make the below METHODORVARIABLENAME field type work Kuromoji itself and its analyzers need to be seen by the Solr classloader",
      "However these are currently in contrib and I am wondering if we should consider moving them to core to make them directly available",
      "If there are concerns with additional memory usage etc",
      "for non Japanese users we can make sure resources are loaded lazily and only when needed in factory land",

      "Provide a means to temporarily cache a child Entity s data without needing to create a special cached implementation of the Entity Processor such as SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "",
      "Provide a means to write the final root entity DIH output to a cache rather than to Solr",
      "Then provide a way for a subsequent DIH call to use the cache as an Entity input",
      "Also provide the ability to do delta updates on such persistent caches",
      "",
      "Provide the ability to partition data across multiple caches that can then be fed back into DIH and indexed either to varying Solr Shards or to the same Core in parallel",
      "Use Cases",
      "We needed a flexible scalable way to temporarily cache child entity data prior to joining to parent entities",
      "using sqlentityprocessor with child entities can cause an n select problem",
      "cachedsqlentityprocessor only supports an in memory hashmap as a caching mechanism and does not scale",
      "there is no way to cache non sql inputs ex flat files xml etc",
      "",
      "We needed the ability to gather data from long running entities by a process that runs separate from our main indexing process",
      "",
      "We wanted the ability to do a delta import of only the entities that changed",
      "lucene solr requires entire documents to be re indexed even if only a few fields changed",
      "our data comes from complex sql queries and or flat files",
      "we do not want to incur overhead re gathering all of this data if only entity s data changed",
      "persistent dih caches solve this problem",
      "",
      "We want the ability to index several documents in parallel using VERSIONNUMBER which did not have the threads parameter",

      "i believe this may be incompatible due to generic usage",
      "note i did not modify the ant script to automatically get this jar so to use or evaluate this patch download bdb je from weblink",

      "Change the semantics of METHODORVARIABLENAME previously it was being called on each iteration of METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "now it is does one time cleanup tasks like closing or deleting a disk backed cache once the entity processor is completed",
      "the only out of the box entity processor that previously implemented destroy was lineentitiyprocessor so this is not a very invasive change",
      "General Notes We are near completion in converting our search functionality from a legacy search engine to Solr",
      "However I found that DIH did not support caching to the level of our prior product s data import utility",

      "This patch is for adding support for date facets when using distributed searches",
      "Date faceting across multiple machines exposes some time based issues that anyone interested in this behaviour should be aware of Any time and or time zone differences are not accounted for in the patch ie",
      "merged date facets are at a time of day not necessarily at a universal instant in time unless all shards are time synced to the exact same time",
      "The implementation uses the first encountered shard s facet_dates as the basis for subsequent shards data to be merged in",
      "This means that if subsequent shards facet_dates are skewed in relation to the first by gap these earlier or later facets will not be merged in",
      "There are several reasons for this performance it is faster to check facet_date lists against a single map s data rather than against each other particularly if there are many shards",
      "if earlier and or later facet_dates are added in this will make the time range larger than that which was requested",
      "eg",
      "a request for one hour s worth of facets could bring back or more hours of data This could be dealt with if timezone and skew information was added and the dates were normalized",
      "One possibility for adding such support is to optionally add timezone and now parameters to the facet_dates map",
      "This would tell requesters what time and TZ the remote server thinks it is and so multiple shards time data can be normalized",
      "The patch affects files in the Solr core FILEPATH FILEPATH The main changes are in SIMPLECLASSNAME SIMPLECLASSNAME is just to hold the completed SIMPLECLASSNAME until the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "One possible enhancement is to perhaps make this an optional parameter but really if METHODORVARIABLENAME parameters are specified it is assumed they are desired",
      "Comments suggestions welcome",
      "As a favour to ask if anyone could take my source files and create a PATCH file from it it would be greatly appreciated as I am having a bit of trouble with svn do not shoot me but my environment is a Redmond based os company"

      "The most important example is SIMPLECLASSNAME which changed its behaviour with SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME and incorrect host token types in VERSIONNUMBER and also in VERSIONNUMBER",
      "In Lucene VERSIONNUMBER this SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME ctor parameter is mandatory and in VERSIONNUMBER with much more Unicode support almost every Tokenizer TokenFilter needs this Version parameter",
      "In VERSIONNUMBER the deprecated old ctors without Version take LUCENE_ as default to mimic the old behaviour eg",
      "in SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "This patch adds basic support for the Lucene Version property to the base factories",
      "Subclasses then can use the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME decoded enum in VERSIONNUMBER Parameter in VERSIONNUMBER for constructing Tokenstreams",
      "The code currently contains a helper map to decode the version strings but in VERSIONNUMBER is can be replaced by METHODORVARIABLENAME String as the Version is a subclass of Java enums",
      "The default value is METHODORVARIABLENAME as this is the default for the no version ctors in Lucene",
      "This patch also removes unneeded conversions to SIMPLECLASSNAME from SIMPLECLASSNAME now done by Lucene since VERSIONNUMBER",
      "The generics are also fixed to match Lucene VERSIONNUMBER"

    ],
    "description": [
      "This patch contains a contrib module that provides distributed indexing using Hadoop to Solr SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "The idea behind this module is twofold provide an api that is familiar to hadoop developers ie",
      "that of outputformat",
      "avoid unnecessary export and de serialization of data maintained on hdfs",
      "solroutputformat consumes data produced by reduce tasks directly without storing it in intermediate files",
      "furthermore by using an embeddedsolrserver the indexing task is split into as many parts as there are reducers and the data to be indexed is not sent over the network",
      "Design Key value pairs produced by reduce tasks are passed to SIMPLECLASSNAME which in turn uses SIMPLECLASSNAME to write this data",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME instantiates an SIMPLECLASSNAME and it also instantiates an implementation of SIMPLECLASSNAME which is responsible for turning Hadoop key value into a SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "This data is then added to a batch which is periodically submitted to SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "When reduce task completes and the SIMPLECLASSNAME is closed SIMPLECLASSNAME calls commit and optimize on the SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "The API provides facilities to specify an arbitrary existing METHODORVARIABLENAME directory from which the conf and lib files will be taken",
      "This process results in the creation of as many partial Solr home directories as there were reduce tasks",
      "The output shards are placed in the output directory on the default filesystem eg",
      "HDFS",
      "Such part NNNNN directories can be used to run N shard servers",
      "Additionally users can specify the number of reduce tasks in particular reduce task in which case the output will consist of a single shard",
      "An example application is provided that processes large CSV files and uses this API",
      "It uses a custom CSV processing to avoid de serialization overhead",
      "This patch relies on hadoop core FILEPATH I attached the jar to this issue you should put it in contrib hadoop lib",
      "Note the development of this patch was sponsored by an anonymous contributor and approved for release under Apache License"

      "Share reusable fragments of schema configuration between multiple cores",
      "Usage FILEPATH This FILEPATH will be used to illustrates using properties for different purpose",

      "METHODORVARIABLENAME METHODORVARIABLENAME with aliases if the list is long or repetitive it might be convenient to use a property that can then be used to describe the Solr core name",

      "The METHODORVARIABLENAME will be set for each of them from the FILEPATH",

      "STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK FILEPATH The METHODORVARIABLENAME allows to import a file within the schema or a solrconfig this can help de clutter long schemas or reuse parts",
      "The METHODORVARIABLENAME is just illustrating that a field its type can be set through properties as well in our example we will want the english core to refer to an english configured field and the french core to a french configured one",
      "The type for the field is defined as METHODORVARIABLENAME or METHODORVARIABLENAME after expansion",
      "STRUCTUREDCODEBLOCK This schema is importing this text FILEPATH file which is a fragment the fragment tag must be present indicates the file is to be included",
      "Our example only defines different stopwords for each language but you could of course extend this to stemmers synonyms etc",

      "But when any admin or approved user tries to add an attachment to any page they get redirected to an FILEPATH page showing a METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "To try and track down the error source I rewrote the SIMPLECLASSNAME class and added a number of additional debug messages",
      "Based on what I am seeing it appears to me that the error is caused by the METHODORVARIABLENAME req returning an empty List SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME in the upload method",
      "I added a debug line to verify the contents of the request and it is properly populated entering the upload method but it is consumed METHODORVARIABLENAME progressid",
      "I commented out the use of the progress bar and found the request consumption moves to the context creation METHODORVARIABLENAME req METHODORVARIABLENAME Once it is consumed there there is nothing left for the METHODORVARIABLENAME req to read",

      "Taken from WEBLINK What I am considering is potentially a solution to the note in that method concerning the unwieldy nature of the current approach of building the SIMPLECLASSNAME s managers namely a new SIMPLECLASSNAME that would sequentially create all the current managers according to a configuration file such that each manager entity could then be referred to by name",
      "This would also permit additional entities like my new manager to be added and subsequently referred to by name",
      "The only thing one would need to gain access to the SIMPLECLASSNAME would be the SIMPLECLASSNAME itself all other managers would therefore be available by name and all of the existing getter methods could be deprecated and eventually the SIMPLECLASSNAME would therefore be simplified",
      "The SIMPLECLASSNAME would spawn a singleton SIMPLECLASSNAME and then let it handle access to those entities",
      "The configuration for the SIMPLECLASSNAME would be an XML file where each individual entity configuration would include the following parameters identifier package name of the entity",
      "boot order parameter n or order in file is used",
      "boolean stating whether the entity can be modified replaced",
      "once created access modifiers suggesting permitted access to the entity",
      "private only to the SIMPLECLASSNAME itself protected only to METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "code public open access not sure how to do this but could get some advice from one of the team s security experts anything else",
      "This would obviously involve a substantial rewiring of the engine and current managers as they tend to gain access to each other via the SIMPLECLASSNAME hence the idea of deprecating the existing methods in SIMPLECLASSNAME and implementing their current getters via the SIMPLECLASSNAME rather than eliminating them outright",
      "Once done though this would greatly simplify the SIMPLECLASSNAME itself",
      "It basically would have a new bootstrap manager",
      "To give you an idea of what problem I am trying to solve we are currently developing an updated SIMPLECLASSNAME based on Murray Altheim s existing SIMPLECLASSNAME and related features to provide a tagging solution for SIMPLECLASSNAME as well as a SIMPLECLASSNAME to provide a wiki related Groovy scripting solution supporting an update to our older SIMPLECLASSNAME but also permitting a wiki page based command console obviously not for use on public wikis",
      "You would have a on page form as a console drawing upon a bin directory of Groovy scripts basically a file based DSL over Groovy command line functionality",
      "So you could write a METHODORVARIABLENAME file put it in the WEB INF bin directory and be able to type HelloWorld into the console command line",
      "That kind of thing",
      "We have this mostly working already so this is basically a way to add a new manager without either adding a getter to the SIMPLECLASSNAME or gaining access via some singleton trickery"

      "When they try to login it fails but the FILEPATH does not tell anything at all not even that is has failed METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "In most cases because either the userid has become inactive is revoked or the password is expired",
      "The net effect is that the wiki is often not usable for updates",
      "Now I know that giving this information the failure reason to the user is often considered a security trade off",
      "But in an intranet environment this is very acceptable",
      "I will attach a patch that solves this in the following way authenticationmanager keeps a hashtable of last loginmessages for each user",
      "the wikicallbackhandler now also handles textoutputcallbacks and sets the login result",
      "if the login fails the loginactionbean first reads the loginmessage for the user if it is not null it is displayed else you get the old behavior",
      "The exploitation of SIMPLECLASSNAME is optional the default SIMPLECLASSNAME supplied with SIMPLECLASSNAME does not use them and therefore it is behavior is unchanged",

      "This is a formal feature request because I could not find an existing issue for the Admin Creates User Profiles Idea here WEBLINK Once way to implement it would be that a different permission createProfile be added still configurable in the METHODORVARIABLENAME file",
      "This way the desired policy could be configured such that the admin group has the createProfile permission while the Authenticated have their editProfile permission",
      "Workarounds are presented here WEBLINK but have drawbacks including allowing arbitrary junk accounts or forcing security to be configured external to the application",
      "The proposal above a new createProfile permission seems like a straightforward way to address this concern directly in the product expanding its usefulness without weird workarounds"

      "The problem arising is that on the server side the page is still marked as being edited for a potentially long time",
      "In the meantime other users cannot really edit the page because they are being warned that someone else is editing it although this may not be true anymore",
      "This would not be a big problem in a rarely visited wiki but it is a really big problem in a frequented wiki",

      "Following on from a discussion on the mailing list WEBLINK It would be good to make Solr play more nicely with existing devops monitoring systems such as Graphite or Ganglia",
      "Stats monitoring at the moment is poll only either via JMX or through the admin stats page",
      "I would like to refactor things a bit to make this more pluggable",
      "This patch is a start",
      "It adds a new interface SIMPLECLASSNAME which extends SIMPLECLASSNAME to return a Metrics WEBLINK SIMPLECLASSNAME and a couple of SIMPLECLASSNAME which basically just duplicate the JMX and admin page reporting that is there at the moment but which should be more extensible",
      "The patch includes a change to SIMPLECLASSNAME showing how this could work",
      "The idea would be to eventually replace the SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME call on SIMPLECLASSNAME with this instead",
      "The next step would be to allow more SIMPLECLASSNAME to be defined in FILEPATH",
      "The Metrics library comes with ganglia and graphite reporting modules and we can add contrib plugins for both of those",
      "There is some more general cleanup that could be done around SIMPLECLASSNAME we have got two plugin handlers at SIMPLECLASSNAME and SIMPLECLASSNAME that basically do the same thing and the beans themselves have some weirdly inconsistent data on them SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME returns different things for different impls and SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME seems pretty useless but maybe that is for another issue"

      "Multiple Solr Cores remove static singleton"
    ],
    "description": [
      "WHAT As of VERSIONNUMBER Solr only instantiates one SIMPLECLASSNAME which handles one Lucene index",
      "This patch is intended to allow multiple cores in Solr which also brings multiple indexes capability",
      "The patch file to grab is solr FILEPATH see MISC session below",
      "WHY The current Solr practical wisdom is that one schema thus one index is most likely to accomodate your indexing needs using a filter to segregate documents if needed",
      "If you really need multiple indexes deploy multiple web applications",
      "There are a some use cases however where having multiple indexes or multiple cores through Solr itself may make sense",
      "Multiple cores Deployment issues within some organizations where IT will resist deploying multiple web applications",
      "Seamless schema update where you can create a new core and switch to it without starting stopping servers",
      "Embedding Solr in your own application instead of raw Lucene and functionally need to segregate schemas collections",
      "Multiple indexes Multiple language collections where each document exists in different languages analysis being language dependant",
      "Having document types that have nothing or very little in common with respect to their schema their lifetime update frequencies or even collection sizes",
      "HOW The best analogy is to consider that instead of deploying multiple web application you can have one web application that hosts more than one Solr core",
      "The patch does not change any of the core logic nor the core code each core is configured behaves exactly as the one core in VERSIONNUMBER the various caches are per core so is the info bean registry",
      "What the patch does is replace the SIMPLECLASSNAME singleton by a collection of cores all the code modifications are driven by the removal of the different singletons the config the schema the core",
      "Each core is named and a static map keyed by name allows to easily manage them",
      "You declare one servlet filter mapping per core you want to expose in the FILEPATH this allows easy to access each core through a different url",
      "USAGE example web deployment patch installed Step java Durl WEBLINK jar FILEPATH FILEPATH METHODORVARIABLENAME Will index the documents in FILEPATH FILEPATH Step WEBLINK Will produce the statistics page from the admin servlet on core index documents Step WEBLINK Will produce the statistics page from the admin servlet on core index no documents Step java Durl WEBLINK jar FILEPATH ipod xml java Durl WEBLINK jar FILEPATH mon xml Adds the FILEPATH to index of core and the FILEPATH to the index of core running queries from the admin interface you can verify indexes have different content",
      "USAGE Java code create a configuration SIMPLECLASSNAME config new SIMPLECLASSNAME FILEPATH create a schema SIMPLECLASSNAME schema new SIMPLECLASSNAME config FILEPATH create a core from the other",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME core new SIMPLECLASSNAME core path to index config schema Accessing a core SIMPLECLASSNAME core METHODORVARIABLENAME core PATCH MODIFICATIONS DETAILS per package METHODORVARIABLENAME The heaviest modifications are in SIMPLECLASSNAME SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME is the most obvious modification instead of a singleton there is a static map of cores keyed by names and assorted methods",
      "To retain some compatibility the null named core replaces the singleton for the relevant methods for instance METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "One small constraint on the core name is they cannot contain or avoiding potential url file path problems",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME SIMPLECLASSNAME are now used to persist all configuration options that need to be quickly accessible to the various components",
      "Most of these variables were static like those found in SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "Mimicking the intent of these static variables SIMPLECLASSNAME SIMPLECLASSNAME use public final members to expose them",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME inherits from Config which has been modified Config is now more strictly a dom document filled from some resource and methods to evaluate xpath expressions",
      "Config also continues to be the classloader singleton that allows to easily instantiate classes located in the Solr installation directory",
      "METHODORVARIABLENAME SIMPLECLASSNAME SIMPLECLASSNAME now get the SIMPLECLASSNAME passed as a parameter to init one might want to read some resources to initialize the factory and the config dir is in the config",
      "This is partially redundant with the argument map though",
      "METHODORVARIABLENAME SIMPLECLASSNAME takes the core as a constructor parameter",
      "METHODORVARIABLENAME The test harness has been modified to expose the core it instantiates",
      "METHODORVARIABLENAME SIMPLECLASSNAME is now instantiating a core configured at init time the FILEPATH must contain one filter declaration and one filter mapping per core you want to expose",
      "Wherever some admin or servlet or page was referring to the SIMPLECLASSNAME singleton or SIMPLECLASSNAME they now check for the request attribute METHODORVARIABLENAME first the filters set this attribute before forwarding to the other parts",
      "Admin servlet Has been modified to use the core exposed through the request attribute METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "REPLICATION The feature has not been implemented yet the starting point is that instead of having just one index directory index the naming scheme for the index data directories is index",
      "Have to investigate",
      "FUTURE Uploading new schema conf would be nice allowing Solr to create cores dynamically the upload mechanism itself is easy the servlet dispatch filter needs to be modified",
      "Having replication embedded in the Solr application itself using an http based version of the rsync algorithm some of the core code of jarsync might be handy",
      "MISC The patch production process not as easy as I thought it was with a Windows Netbeans cygwin TortoiseSVN",
      "Initial point is to have the modified code running in a local patch branch all tests ok Have one clean version of the trunk aside the local patch branch you will need to verify that your patch can be applied to the last clean trunk version and that various tests still work from there",
      "Creating the patch is key",
      "If you used some IDE and forgot to set the auto indentation corrrectly you most likely need working around the space indentation patch clutter that results",
      "I could not find a way to get SIMPLECLASSNAME create a patch with the proper options ignore spaces al and could not find a way to get SIMPLECLASSNAME generate one either",
      "Thus I create the patch from the local trunk root through cygwin with svn patchutils svn different different cmd SIMPLECLASSNAME bin different x w B b E d N you solr METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "Before generating the patch it is important to issue an svn add for each file you might have added a quick svn status grep",
      "allows to verify nothing will be missing",
      "Not elegant but you can even follow with svn status grep",
      "awk print xargs svn add Apply the patch to the clean trunk",
      "SIMPLECLASSNAME apply patch command only understands unified different thus the you option",
      "Alternatively you can apply the patch through cygwin patch p you solr METHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "I have updated the dev environment to an x Solaris box which now generates the zipped patch solr FILEPATH same patch production method",
      "For Solaris users patch must be gnu patch SIMPLECLASSNAME local bin patch is its usual location not to be confused with SIMPLECLASSNAME patch For x you can find it at ftp WEBLINK pub freeware intel patch VERSIONNUMBER sol x METHODORVARIABLENAME I do not know about different but I am using the version located at ftp WEBLINK pub freeware intel diffutils VERSIONNUMBER sol intel METHODORVARIABLENAME"

      "From the jspwiki dev list Steve Dahl wrote Under SIMPLECLASSNAME VERSIONNUMBER we have replaced SIMPLECLASSNAME with an SIMPLECLASSNAME which implements SIMPLECLASSNAME roles in terms of LDAP groups",
      "When I compile this for SIMPLECLASSNAME VERSIONNUMBER and modify the METHODORVARIABLENAME file to use it our custom SIMPLECLASSNAME gets initialized and is sent SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME but it never seems to get sent SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME",
      "If it is useful information SIMPLECLASSNAME implements Authorizer not SIMPLECLASSNAME and it implements SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME with this signature public boolean SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME SIMPLECLASSNAME session Principal role Is there anything that has changed in Authorizers between VERSIONNUMBER and VERSIONNUMBER that might explain this",
      "Looking deeper it seems that in SIMPLECLASSNAME VERSIONNUMBER SIMPLECLASSNAME implemented SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME which initialized the session with whatever groups and roles the user belongs to",
      "Groups are read from the group database and Roles are read from the Authorizer",
      "In SIMPLECLASSNAME VERSIONNUMBER SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME has been replaced by SIMPLEMETHODORVARIABLENAME which reads groups from the group database but does not use the Authorizer",
      "What is the Authorizer used for now",
      "As a side note I originally implemented SIMPLECLASSNAME as SIMPLECLASSNAME",
      "I ended up rejecting this approach because SIMPLECLASSNAME assumes that the members of a Group can be read once when the Wiki is started and that the Group s membership will only be modified by the Wiki",
      "The problem with LDAP is that the group membership can be modified from outside and the only way to update the wiki would be to manually restart it",
      "The Authorizer was a better solution for our purposes because if a user was added to the LDAP group the Authorizer would reflect that change as soon as the user logged out and back in",

      "Quite a few people have shown up recently on the mailing list and have expressed a wish to separate the rendering engine from the core itself so that they would not need so much baggage with the engine",

      "However these things could be enumerated and isolated to a SIMPLECLASSNAME interface",

      "However that might not be such a bad thing as it would give a more stable developer API",
      "Then we would have a three layered architecture where one layer WikiEngine takes care of static stuff SIMPLECLASSNAME contains per request data and SIMPLECLASSNAME provides the bits and pieces which are part of HTML generation",
